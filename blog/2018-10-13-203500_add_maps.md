We have added maps to the site, thanks to OpenStreetMaps' awesome maps.

Now you are able to view where each event took place. If an event did not happen like the Aqours Sapporo fanmeet in 2018, you can [see the reason why](/aqours/events/65) too!

We also went in and dug out a venue that does not exist anymore! [Î¼'s First LoveLive!](/muse/events/3) was held in [Yokohama BLITZ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A8%AA%E6%B5%9CBLITZ), which closed in 2013.

The building that housed it was [demolished in 2015](http://ginmaku.air-nifty.com/photo/2015/05/109mmgento-yoko.html).
